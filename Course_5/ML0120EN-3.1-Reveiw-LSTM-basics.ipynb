It's very computationally expensive to maintain the state for a large amount of units, even more so over a long amount of time. Additionally, Recurrent Networks are very sensitive to changes in their parameters. As such, they are prone to different problems with their Gradient Descent optimizer -- they either grow exponentially (Exploding Gradient) or drop down to near zero and stabilize (Vanishing Gradient), both problems that greatly harm a model's learning capability.\n","\n","To solve these problems, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber published a paper in 1997 describing a way to keep information over long periods of time and additionally solve the oversensitivity to parameter changes, i.e., make backpropagating through the Recurrent Networks more viable. This proposed method is called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).\n","\n","(In this notebook, we will cover only LSTM and its implementation using TensorFlow)\n","\n","\u003chr\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2d3eb18f-5f8f-4664-ac75-79a352ddf96e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003ca id=\"long_short_term_memory_model\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n","\n","\u003ch2\u003eLong Short-Term Memory Model\u003c/h2\u003e\n","\n","The Long Short-Term Memory, as it was called, was an abstraction of how computer memory works. It is \"bundled\" with whatever processing unit is implemented in the Recurrent Network, although outside of its flow, and is responsible for keeping, reading, and outputting information for the model. The way it works is simple: you have a linear unit, which is the information cell itself, surrounded by three logistic gates responsible for maintaining the data. One gate is for inputting data into the information cell, one is for outputting data from the input cell, and the last one is to keep or forget data depending on the needs of the network.\n","\n","Thanks to that, it not only solves the problem of keeping states, because the network can choose to forget data whenever information is not needed, it also solves the gradient problems, since the Logistic Gates have a very nice derivative.\n","\n","\u003ch3\u003eLong Short-Term Memory Architecture\u003c/h3\u003e\n","\n","The Long Short-Term Memory is composed of a linear unit surrounded by three logistic gates.

These gates are analog and multiplicative, and as such, can modify the data based on the signal they are sent.\n","\n","\u003chr\u003e\n","\n","For example, an usual flow of operations for the LSTM unit is as such: First off, the Keep Gate has to decide whether to keep or forget the data currently stored in memory.

If $K\n","_t$ has value of 1 means that the LSTM unit should keep the data stored perfectly and if $K_t$ a value of 0 means that it should forget it entirely. Consider $S_{t-1}$ as the incoming (previous) state, $x_t$ as the incoming input, and $W_k$, $B_k$ as the weight and bias for the Keep Gate.
